The concept of a 'machine that can think' was introduced by Alan Turing in 1950. The term 'artificial intelligence' was coined during the Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1956. The period from 1956 to 1974 is often referred to as 'The golden years' of AI. However, by mid-1970s, the complexity of creating 'intelligent machines' led to a period known as 'AI Winter'. The 1980s saw the rise of 'expert systems'. The period from 1993 to 2011 marked a new era for ML and AI with the increase in data and compute power. Today, machine learning and AI touch almost every part of our lives.\"}\n",
      "{ \"kb\": \"Techniques of Machine Learning\", \"content\": \"The process of machine learning involves several steps: deciding on the question, collecting and preparing data, choosing a training method, training the model, evaluating the model, parameter tuning, and prediction. Before building a model, tasks such as data collection and preparation, feature and target selection, data visualization, and dataset splitting are necessary. The model is built using training data and a chosen training method. The model's quality is evaluated using test data. If necessary, the model can be improved by tweaking its 'hyperparameters'. Finally, new data is used to test the model's accuracy.\" }\n",

The concept of a 'machine that can think' was introduced by Alan Turing in 1950. The term 'artificial intelligence' was coined during the Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1956. The period from 1956 to 1974 is often referred to as 'The golden years' of AI. However, by mid-1970s, the complexity of creating 'intelligent machines' led to a period known as 'AI Winter'. The 1980s saw the rise of 'expert systems'. The period from 1993 to 2011 marked a new era for ML and AI with the increase in data and compute power. Today, machine learning and AI touch almost every part of our lives.\"},\n",

Before building a model, tasks such as data collection and preparation, feature and target selection, data visualization, and dataset splitting are necessary. The model is built using training data and a chosen training method. The model's quality is evaluated using test data. If necessary, the model can be improved by tweaking its 'hyperparameters'. Finally, new data is used to test the model's accuracy.\"},\n",
