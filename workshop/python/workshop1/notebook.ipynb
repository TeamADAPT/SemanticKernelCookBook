      "{\"kb\": \"History of machine learning\", \"content\": \"The history of machine learning and artificial intelligence is marked by significant milestones. Notable discoveries include Bayes Theorem (1763, 1812), Least Square Theory (1805), Markov Chains (1913), Perceptron (1957), Nearest Neighbor (1967), Backpropagation (1970), and Recurrent Neural Networks (1982). Alan Turing laid the foundation for the concept of a 'machine that can think' in 1950. The Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1956 was a seminal event for AI as a field. The period from 1956 to 1974 is often referred to as 'The golden years' of AI. However, by the mid-1970s, the complexity of creating 'intelligent machines' had been understated and its promise overblown, leading to an 'AI Winter'. The 1980s saw the proliferation of 'expert systems'. The period from 1993 to 2011 saw a new era for ML and AI to solve some of the problems caused earlier by the lack of data and compute power. Today, machine learning and AI touch almost every part of our lives.\"}\n",
      "{\"kb\": \"Techniques of Machine Learning\", \"content\": \"The process of machine learning involves several steps: deciding on the question, collecting and preparing data, choosing a training method, training the model, evaluating the model, parameter tuning, and prediction. Before building a model, tasks such as data collection and preparation, feature and target selection, data visualization, and dataset splitting are necessary. The model is built using training data and a chosen method. The model's quality is evaluated using test data. If necessary, the model can be improved by tweaking its 'hyperparameters'. Finally, new data is used to test the model's accuracy.\"}\n",

Alan Turing laid the foundation for the concept of a 'machine that can think' in 1950. The Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1956 was a seminal event for AI as a field. The period from 1956 to 1974 is often referred to as 'The golden years' of AI. However, by the mid-1970s, the complexity of creating 'intelligent machines' had been understated and its promise overblown, leading to an 'AI Winter'. The 1980s saw the proliferation of 'expert systems'. The period from 1993 to 2011 saw a new era for ML and AI to solve some of the problems caused earlier by the lack of data and compute power. Today, machine learning and AI touch almost every part of our lives.\"},\n",
