Notable discoveries include Bayes Theorem (1763, 1812), Least Square Theory (1805), Markov Chains (1913), Perceptron (1957), Nearest Neighbor (1967), Backpropagation (1970), and Recurrent Neural Networks (1982). Key periods include the conceptualization of 'machines that can think' by Alan Turing in 1950, the Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1956, the 'golden years' of AI from 1956 to 1974, the 'AI Winter' from 1974 to 1980 due to limitations and criticisms, the rise of 'expert systems' in the 1980s, the 'AI Chill' from 1987 to 1993 due to over-specialization, and the resurgence of ML and AI from 1993 to 2011 due to increased data and computational power. Today, ML and AI are integral parts of our lives, necessitating careful understanding of their impacts and ethical considerations.\"},\n",

Before building a model, tasks such as data collection and preparation, feature and target selection, data visualization, and dataset splitting are necessary. The model building process involves deciding on a training method, training the model, and evaluating it. The quality of the model can be improved by tweaking its 'hyperparameters' in a process known as parameter tuning. Finally, the model's accuracy is tested using completely new data in the prediction stage.\"},\n",
