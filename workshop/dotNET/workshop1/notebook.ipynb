rules in contrast AI shines in solving problems where the solution can be extracted from data many of the problems we encountered in our daily life can be efficiently solved with traditional programming if an engineer can break up the solution of a problem and Define it using precise rules then traditional programming is a great tool to use but many of the problems we encounter in our day-to-day aren&#39;t quite as easy to Define as a set of rules thankfully for many of those problems we have access to plenty of real life data containing useful information which means that AI can help us find a solution one good example is translating from one language to another writing a set of rules that full encodes all the parallels between two languages is not easy but there are many examples of translation online so AI has been able to do a much better job of translation than previous attempts so our first step when we&#39;re starting a new project should be to analyze the problem and determine which technique is best to solve it if you&#39;re able to obtain plenty of data that contains useful information about your solution then AI is a promising approach once you

The question to ask in machine learning should be one that cannot be easily answered by a rules-based engine. Before building the model, tasks such as collecting and preparing data, selecting feature variables, visualizing data, and splitting the dataset need to be completed. Building the model involves choosing a training method, training the model, and evaluating its quality. Parameter tuning can be done to improve the model's performance. Finally, predictions can be made using new data. It is important to be aware of issues such as overfitting and underfitting. The process of machine learning requires continuous learning and improvement, and it is helpful to draw a flow chart to understand the steps involved.\"}\n",

rules in contrast AI shines in solving problems where the solution can be extracted from data many of the problems we encountered in our daily life can be efficiently solved with traditional programming if an engineer can break up the solution of a problem and Define it using precise rules then traditional programming is a great tool to use but many of the problems we encounter in our day-to-day aren&#39;t quite as easy to Define as a set of rules thankfully for many of those problems we have access to plenty of real life data containing useful information which means that AI can help us find a solution one good example is translating from one language to another writing a set of rules that full encodes all the parallels between two languages is not easy but there are many examples of translation online so AI has been able to do a much better job of translation than previous attempts so our first step when we&#39;re starting a new project should be to analyze the problem and determine which technique is best to solve it if you&#39;re able to obtain plenty of data that contains useful information about your solution then AI is a promising approach once you

It involves understanding natural language, recognizing speech and images, reasoning and making decisions, and even emotions. AI can be categorized into two types: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI refers to AI systems that are designed to perform a specific task, such as voice assistants, chatbots, or recommendation systems. General AI, on the other hand, refers to AI systems that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do.\n",

Instead of being given specific instructions, ML algorithms learn from examples and experience to make predictions or take actions. The key idea behind ML is that machines can automatically learn and adapt without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario.\n",

In supervised learning, the algorithm is provided with labeled data, where each example has a corresponding label or target value.

This type of learning is commonly used in applications such as image recognition, text classification, and predictive modeling.\n",

      "Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with unlabeled data, where the algorithm has to find patterns or structures in the data without any explicit guidance.
