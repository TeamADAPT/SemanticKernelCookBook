Alan Turing laid the foundation for the concept of a 'machine that can think,' and the Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1956 coined the term 'artificial intelligence.' The 'golden years' from the 1950s to the mid '70s saw optimism and advancements in natural language processing and search. The 'AI Winter' in the mid '70s to 1980s saw a decline in funding and confidence. The 1980s saw the rise of expert systems, and the 1990s to 2011 marked a new era with increased data availability and compute power.

      "\n",
      "On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on designing algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. ML algorithms are trained on large amounts of data to recognize patterns, identify relationships, and make intelligent decisions.\n",

      "One key distinction between AI and ML is that AI encompasses a broader scope of techniques beyond just machine learning. AI includes rule-based systems, expert systems, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. ML, on the other hand, specifically relies on algorithms that can learn from data and improve their performance as more data is provided.\n",

      "Deep learning is an advanced subset of ML that utilizes artificial neural networks to learn and make predictions. These neural networks are composed of interconnected layers of nodes that mimic the human brain's structure. Deep learning has gained a lot of attention and success in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n",
